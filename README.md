# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

2. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

3. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).

4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Program Structure

The program consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file contains the game layout and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the game container and cells.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including cell clicks, win conditions, and updating the game state.

The game is designed with modularity in mind, separating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The `index.html` file sets up the game board and includes the necessary elements for rendering the game. The `style.css` file is responsible for the visual appearance of the game, such as cell size and layout.

The main logic of the game is implemented in the `index.js` file. It handles player moves, checks win conditions, and updates the game state accordingly. The JavaScript code is organized into functions to improve readability and maintainability.
